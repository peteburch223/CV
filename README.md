## Pete BURCH

Software developer with 20 years experience in a very diverse range of fields. I've designed, managed and developed projects and products for large corporates and small businesses. Freelance for the past thirteen years, I'm now looking to move into a development-oriented role in a small, innovative and agile organisation to which I can make a major contribution.

## Key Skills

#### Software Development
I've designed, developed and deployed a broad range of successful products and tools for clients, using appropriate technologies and methodologies. I've experience with TDD, Azure, C#, .Net, WebAPI, NUnit, SQL Server, MongoDB, TypeScript, React/Redux, complex Excel macros, Windows applications, PHP, XSLT, embedded systems, data cleansing, project monitoring systems, data warehouses and much much more.

#### Management
An experienced project and programme manager, I've looked after multi-continent, multi-disciplinary teams working on million dollar microprocessor IP developments for ARM. I've also run a build-to-order 10 year Grant Management system implementation for EFTA across the entire product lifecycle.

#### Consulting
Most of my career has been in client-facing roles, and I've successfully proposed, sold and implemented projects large and small. I'm as comfortable in the board room as in the design office, and excel in capturing complex ideas and communicating them in ways appropriate to the target audience. I've conducted technical due diligence studies for early-stage investors.

#### Adaptability
I'm not easily pigeonholed. If something needs to be done, I'll figure out how to do it. I'm tenacious, curious, highly-resourceful and love to learn.

## Education

#### Makers Academy : 2016
As a self-taught developer I wanted to consolidate my existing skills and deepen my knowledge of current best practice. In 12 weeks I completed 20 team and individual projects, culminating in a mobile Angular.js music guessing game using the Spotify API.

#### Manchester University
MSc Industrial Engineering : 1993 - 1994

BSc Physics (2.1) : 1990 - 1993

## Professional Qualifications
